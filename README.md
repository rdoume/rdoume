## ðŸ”­ Iâ€™m currently working on: 

Engineering Management for a big team of Data Scientists and ML Engineers (~30), at Artefact, a tech consulting firm based in Paris

I'm also a member of the Board of Data Science of the [AI Infrastructure Alliance](https://ai-infrastructure.org/), where our mission is to bring clarity to the AI space through events, research, education, standards definition and building interoperability.

## âš¡ What you will find here
Nowadays, I'm no sot much an IC as my time is mostly divided between helping my clients building their ML strategies and managing my team and helping them grow. And from time to time, contribute to internal tools we have. 

So, my GH is not as interesting as some other IC. But you can check our [Medium](https://medium.com/artefact-engineering-and-data-science) to have a good understanting at what we do! 

However, I use Github as a personal Knowledge space, I have a LOT of starred repo (too much?), but if you want to know what I'm into at the current time, check [them out](https://github.com/rdoume?tab=stars) 

##  ðŸŒ± Iâ€™m currently learning:

Anything that relates to platform engineering, specially in the context of Machine learning. Trying to improve my way of handling Terraform, or catching up with everything that is happening in the Vector Search domain. 

##  ðŸ‘¯ Iâ€™m looking to collaborate on:

ML Engineering, Dev portal for ML Engineering, how to build better ways to quickly help DS and MLE shipping ML related features into products.




## ðŸ“« How to reach me:

Best way will be on Twitter, or by mail (firstname) @ (lastname) .eu
